# Corny Split Keyboard

My first custom split keyboard that takes inspiration from the [Corne keyboard](https://www.boardsource.xyz/products/Corne).

## Motivation

I’m pretty much a geek who always finds ways to create things tailored specifically for myself. I've been using Arch Linux (BTW), Hyprland (BTW), and Neovim (BTW) for over a year now, and most of my workflow depends heavily on the keyboard.

Over time, I’ve tried 60%, 75%, and 100% mechanical keyboards. They’re all nice, but I struggled to find space on my desk for schoolwork, and placing the keyboard on my laptop caused the battery to heat up. Then one day, I stumbled upon [this video](https://youtu.be/7UXsD7nSfDY?si=9aiY0pJiT80jEVwv), which sparked the idea—and here it is: my first-ever custom-built split keyboard. All the design work was done in less than 5 days.

## Build

This keyboard was created using [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen), with extra helpful guidance from the [Flatfootfox tutorial](https://flatfootfox.com) and HunterCook—a genius and my friend on Discord.

The design is entirely customized for my hand movements and habits. It may not suit your typing style (or even mine, as this is my first attempt). All routing was done manually and can be found in the `ergogen/results/pcbs/` directory, not in `ergogen/output/pcbs`, which contains files auto-generated by Ergogen.

### 1. Layout

The layout was fully created inside [Ergogen](https://ergogen.ceoloide.com).

Here’s my initial design of _Corny_, drawn in Excalidraw:

### 2. Components

For switches, I decided to use `MX switches` instead of `Choc switches` like most others, because MX switches are much easier to find in Vietnam. In fact, I couldn’t find any retailers selling Choc switches on the major e-commerce platforms here. My switch of choice is the [Akko Rosewood](https://en.akkogear.com/product/akko-rosewood-switch/).

> Choc switch (low profile): 17×18mm

> MX switch (The type of switch on normal mechanical keyboard): 19×19mm

For the MCU, I used the [nice!nano v2](https://typeractive.xyz/products/nice-nano?variant=42225114546407) for wireless functionality. However, you can use almost any available MCU, such as the [Pro Micro](https://hshop.vn/arduino-pro-micro) or even a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero/).

### 3. PCBs

The PCBs were auto-generated by [Ergogen](https://ergogen.ceoloide.com) in `.kicad_pcb` format, which you can open in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/). Be sure to connect all routes manually, and aim for an `unrouted` count of zero—otherwise, you'll have unconnected components (oops!).

Here are the final PCB designs:

### 4. The software

I haven't had fund to get the parts yet but there is a tool called [zmk](/zmk-corny-config/) - I will keep the repo private for now since I haven't do anything

### 5. BOM

You can check the BOM in [here](/Corny_BOM.csv)
